# Next.js as Transitive Dep issue

1. Clone this repo
4. cd into `next-transitive` and run `npm install --install-links` (the option is so that the file: is actually installed instead of symlinked)
5. cd into `next-transitive/node_modules/next-app` and try to run `npx next build` or `npm run build`. They will both fail with the following:

```
> my-app@0.1.0 build
> next build

   â–² Next.js 15.0.3
